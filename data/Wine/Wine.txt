Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types,
a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality
assurance. The classes are strawberry (authentic samples) and
non-strawberry (adulterated strawberries and other fruits).
Obtained using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling.
